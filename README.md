## Acknowledgment

This was originally a repository for a "Beginner's R Workshop" that was offered as part of University of Arkansas when I worked there, and since been replicated and modified a few times. The codes are not original or written by me, these are curated from a number of different sources including the excellent tutorials provided by the Ann Arbor R users' group, based on the [Software Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org), [Rachel's R turorial](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/rachael-s-r-tutorials/notebook) and JD's own intro stats teaching materials.
