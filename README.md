# R Working Group Beginner's Workshop

This is a repository for a "Beginner R Workshop" that was offered as part of University of Arkansas when I worked there, and since been replicated and modified a few times. 
The codes are curated from a number of different sources including the excellent tutorials provided by the Ann Arbor R users' group, based on the [Software Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org), [Rachel's R turorial](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/rachael-s-r-tutorials/notebook) and JD's own intro stats teaching materials. 


The following topics are covered. Right now, only the beginners' workshop (stage 1) is built. We will build the next set of topics based on feedback from the group. 

Stage 1:

1.  What is R? 
2.  Vectors and Data types. 
3.  Working with Data frames. 
4.  Manipulating Data with tidyverse. 
5.  Visualization with ggplot.

Stage 2: (work in progress)

1.  Efficiency consideration: apply and parallel. 
2.  Dynamic documentation: **R markdown**
3.  (Very basic) Statistics.
4.  Exploratory Data Analysis  

Stage 3: (work in progress)

1. Univariate Regression 
2. Multivariate Regression. 
3. High-dimensional regression 
4. Classification 
5. Resampling
