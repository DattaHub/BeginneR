# UA R Working Group Beginner's Workshop

This is a repository for the Beginner R Workshop. 
The codes are curated from a number of different sources including the excellent tutorials provided by the Ann Arbor R users' group, based on the [Software Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org), [Rachel's R turorial](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/rachael-s-r-tutorials/notebook) and JD's own teaching materials. 


The following topics are covered. Right now, only the beginners' workshop (stage 1) is built. We will build the next set of topics based on feedback from the group. 

Stage 1:

1.  What is R? 
2.  Vectors and Data types. 
3.  Working with Data frames. 
4.  Manipulating Data with tidyverse. 
5.  Visualization with ggplot.

Stage 2:

1.  Efficiency consideration: apply and parallel. 
2.  Dynamic documentation: **R markdown**
3.  (Very basic) Statistics.
4.  Advanced Statistical Topics. 

Stage 3:

1.  Handling high-dimensional data (Lasso/Horseshoe)
2.  Building Random Forests.
3.  Neural network. 
4.  Social Media Data Mining.
