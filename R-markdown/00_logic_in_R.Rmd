# (Almost) Everything is a Vector

---
  
## Types of vectors
  
  The fundamental building block of data in R are vectors (collections of related values, objects, other data structures, etc).

<br/>
  
  R has two fundamental vector classes:
  
  * Vectors (atomic vectors) 

- collections of values that are all of the *same* type (e.g. all logical values, all numbers, or all character strings).

* Lists (generic vectors)

- collections of *any* type of R object, even other lists (meaning they can have a hierarchical/tree-like structure).

---
  
## Atomic Vectors
  
  R has six atomic vector types: 
  
|  typeof    |   mode    | storage.mode 
|:-----------|:----------|:-------------
| logical    | logical   | logical      
| double     | numeric   | double       
| integer    | numeric   | integer      
| character  | character | character    
| complex    | complex   | complex      
| raw        | raw       | raw          

<br/>
  
For now we'll mainly worry about the first type, we'll discuss the following three next time (last two almost never come up).

  ## Logical (boolean) operations
  
|  Operator  |  Operation    |  Vectorized? 
|:-----------|:--------------|:-------------
| <code>x &#124; y</code>    |  or           |   Yes        
| `x & y`    |  and          |   Yes        
| `!x`       |  not          |   Yes        
| <code>x &#124;&#124; y</code> |  or           |   No         
| `x && y`   |  and          |   No         
|`xor(x,y)`  |  exclusive or |   Yes        


---
class: split-50

## Vectorized?

```{r}
x = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
y = c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
  x | y
  x || y
 ```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
  x & y
  x && y
 ```
]


---
class: split-50

## Length coercion

```{r}
x = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
y = c(TRUE)
z = c(FALSE,TRUE)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
  x | y
  y | z
  ```
]

.pull-right[
 ```{r}
  x & y
  y & z
  ```
]

```{r}
x | z
```

---
  
## Comparisons
  
 Operator  |  Comparison                |  Vectorized?
:-----------|:---------------------------|:-----------------
`x < y`    |  less than                 |  Yes
`x > y`    |  greater than              |  Yes
`x <= y`   |  less than or equal to     |  Yes
`x >= y`   |  greater than or equal to  |  Yes
`x != y`   |  not equal to              |  Yes
`x == y`   |  equal to                  |  Yes
`x %in% y` |  contains                  |  Yes (for `x`)


---
class: split-50

## Comparisons

```{r}
x = c("A","B","C")
z = c("A")
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
  x == z
  x != z
  x > z
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
  x %in% z
  z %in% x
```
]

---
  
## Conditional Control Flow
  
Conditional execution of code blocks is achieved via `if` statements. 

*Note that `if` statements are **not** vectorized.*
  
```{r, error = TRUE}
x = c(3,1)

if (3 %in% x)
  "Here!"
if (x >= 2)
  "Now Here!"
```

---
class: split-50

## Collapsing logical vectors

There are a couple of helper functions for collapsing a logical vector down to a single value: `any`, `all`

```{r}
x = c(3,4)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
  any(x >= 2)
  all(x >= 2)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
  !any(x >= 2)
  if (any(x >= 2))
    print("Now There!")
```
]


---
  
## Nesting Conditionals
  
```{r}
x = 3
if (x < 0) {
  "Negative"
} else if (x > 0) {
  "Positive"
} else {
  "Zero"
}
```

```{r}
x = 0
if (x < 0) {
  "Negative"
} else if (x > 0) {
  "Positive"
} else {
  "Zero"
}
```

# Error Checking

---
  
## `stop` and `stopifnot`
  
Often we want to validate user input or function arguments - if our assumptions are not met then we often want to report the error and stop execution. 

```{r error=TRUE}
ok = FALSE
if (!ok)
  stop("Things are not ok.")

stopifnot(ok)
```

*Note - an error (like the one generated by `stop`) will prevent an RMarkdown document from compiling unless `error=TRUE` is set for that code block.*
  
---
  
## Style choices
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Do stuff
if (condition_one) {
  ##
  ## Do stuff
  ##
} else if (condition_two) {
  ##
  ## Do other stuff
  ##
} else if (condition_error) {
  stop("Condition error occured")
}
```

---
  
## Style choices

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Do stuff better
if (condition_error) {
  stop("Condition error occured")
}

if (condition_one) {
  ##
  ## Do stuff
  ##
} else if (condition_two) {
  ##
  ## Do other stuff
  ##
}
```

### Ultimately, it's subjective !

---
  
## Exercise 1
  
  Write a set of conditional(s) that satisfies the following requirements,

* If `x` is greater than 3 and `y` is less than or equal to 3 then print "Hello world!"

* Otherwise if `x` is greater than 3 print "!dlrow olleH"

* If `x` is less than or equal to 3 then print "Something else ..."

* Stop execution if x is odd and y is even and report an error, don't print any of the text strings above.


Test out your code by trying various values of `x` and `y`.

# Loops

---

## `for` loops

Simplest, and most common type of loop in R - given a vector iterate through the elements and evaluate the code block for each.


```{r}
for(x in 1:10)
{
  cat(x^2,"")
}
```

```{r}
for(y in list(1:3, LETTERS[1:7], c(TRUE,FALSE)))
{
  cat(length(y),"")
}
```

---

## `while` loops

Repeat until the given condition is **not** met (i.e. evaluates to `FALSE`)

```{r}
i = 1
res = rep(NA,10)

while (i <= 10) {
  res[i] = i^2
  i = i+1
}

res
```

---

## `repeat` loops

Repeat until `break`

```{r}
i = 1
res = rep(NA,10)

repeat {
  res[i] = i^2
  i = i+1
  if (i > 10)
    break
}

res
```

---
class: split-50

## Special keywords - `break` and `next`

These are special actions that only work *inside* of a loop

* `break` - ends the current *loop* (inner-most)
* `next` - ends the current *iteration*

.pull-left[
```{r}
for(i in 1:10) {
    if (i %% 2 == 0)
        break
    cat(i,"")
}
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
for(i in 1:10) {
    if (i %% 2 == 0)
        next
    cat(i,"")
}
```
]


---
class: split-50

## Some helper functions

Often we want to use a loop across the indexes of an object and not the elements themselves. There are several useful functions to help you do this: `:`, `length`, `seq`, `seq_along`, `seq_len`, etc.

```{r}
4:7
seq(4,7,by=1)
seq_along(4:7)
seq_len(length(4:7))
```

---

## Exercise 2

Below is the list of primes between 2 and 100:
```
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 
43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
```

If you were given the vector `x = c(3, 4, 12, 19, 23, 48, 50, 61, 63, 78)`, write out the R code necessary to print only the values of `x` that are *not* prime (without using subsetting or the `%in%` operator). 

Your code should use *nested* loops to iterate through the vector of primes and `x`.

## Next we will look at functions

source: [https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html)

---

## When to use functions

The goal of a function should be to encapsulate a *small* *reusable* piece of code.

* Name should make it clear what the function does (think in terms of simple verbs).

* Functionality should be simple enough to be quickly understood.

* The smaller and more modular the code the easier it will be to reuse elsewhere.

* Better to change code in one location than code everywhere.

---
## When to use ...

Writing a function has four big advantages over using copy-and-paste:

-  You can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.

-  As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.

-  You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).

-  It makes it easier to reuse work from project-to-project, increasing your productivity over time.

Rule-of-thumb: did you copy-paste a block of code more than twice? 

---
## What does this do?

```{r, eval = TRUE}
df <- tibble::tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)

df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$c, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))
```


---
## Error in copy-paste

You might be able to puzzle out that this rescales each column to have a range from 0 to 1. 

But did you spot the mistake? I made an error when copying-and-pasting the code for df$b: I forgot to change an a to a b. 

Extracting repeated code out into a function is a good idea because it prevents you from making this type of mistake.

---
## What does this do?

```{r, eval = TRUE}
df <- tibble::tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)

df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE)) /            #<<
  (max(df$b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$c, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---
## Write a function

To write a function you need to first analyse the code. How many inputs does it have?

```{r}
(df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))/(max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
```

-  Why is `TRUE` not an input? 

-  To make the inputs more clear, it’s a good idea to rewrite the code using temporary variables with general names. Here this code only requires a single numeric vector, so I’ll call it x:

```{r}
x <- df$a
(x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---
## Redundancy?

There is some duplication in this code. We’re computing the range of the data three times, so it makes sense to do it in one step:

```{r}
rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
(x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
```

Pulling out intermediate calculations into named variables is a good practice because it makes it more clear what the code is doing. 

---
## Turn this into a function

Now that I’ve simplified the code, and checked that it still works, I can turn it into a function:

```{r}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}
rescale01(c(0, 5, 10))
```

---
## Use with earlier example

We can simplify the original example now that we have a function:

```{r}
df$a <- rescale01(df$a)
df$b <- rescale01(df$b)
df$c <- rescale01(df$c)
df$d <- rescale01(df$d)
```

Compare this with the original block of code. 


---
## Change easily 

Another advantage of functions is that if our requirements change, we only **need to make the change in one place**.

For example, we might discover that some of our variables include infinite values, and `rescale01()` fails:

```{r, error = T}
x <- c(1:10, Inf)
rescale01(x)
```

Because we’ve extracted the code into a function, we only need to make the fix in one place:

```{r}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE, finite = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}
rescale01(x)
```

---
## Exercise 

- Why is `TRUE` not a parameter to `rescale01()`? What would happen if `x` contained a single missing value, and `na.rm` was FALSE?

- In the second variant of `rescale01()`, infinite values are left unchanged. Rewrite `rescale01()` so that `-Inf` is mapped to 0, and `Inf` is mapped to 1.

- Write your own functions to compute the skewness of a numeric vector. Skewness is defined as: 

$$
Skew(x) = \frac{\frac{1}{n-2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^3}{Var(x)^{3/2}}
$$
Compare with the function skewness in library moments.

```{r}
# calculate skewness in r
install.packages("moments")
library(moments)

skewness(x)
```

## Now, we will dissect the structure of a function in R

source: [https://statprog-s1-2020.github.io/](https://statprog-s1-2020.github.io/)

---
## Functions 

- Functions are blocks of code that allows R to be modular and facilitate code reuse.
- An R programmer can define their own functions as follows:
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
function_name <- function([arg1], [arg2], ...){
#function code body
}
```

- The function arguments are optional. Function arguments are the variables passed to the function, used by the function's code to perform calculations. A function can take no arguments.
- A function can also return any R primitive or object using the `return(object)` statement.

---
## Function arguments 

Functions have named arguments which potentially have default values.

The _formal arguments_ are the arguments included in the
function definition

The `formals` function returns a list of all the formal
arguments of a function 

Not every function call in R makes use of all the formal
arguments

Function arguments can be missing or might have default
values

---
## Argument matching 

R functions arguments can be matched positionally or by name. So the following calls to `sd` are all equivalent.

```{r}
mydata <- rnorm(100)
 sd(mydata)
 sd(x = mydata)
 sd(x = mydata, na.rm = FALSE)
 sd(na.rm = FALSE, x = mydata)
 sd(na.rm = FALSE, mydata)
```

**But don't mess around with the order too much!**


---
## Examples 

-  Examples of two different functions 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# computes the mean of a vector of numbers
mean <- function(a_vector) {
s <- sum(a_vector)
x <- s/length(a_vector)
}
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# checks to see if a string s starts with letter x
startsWith <- function(x, s){
if(x == substr(s, 0, 1){
return(TRUE)
}
return(FALSE)
}
```

---
## Anatomy of a function

-  **Default arguments**
-  Function arguments can be assigned default values as follows:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sort_vector <- function(a_vector, ascending=TRUE){
# sorting algorithm
}
```
- When calling this function, the arguments given default values do not need to be specified. In this case, the defaults are used.
- Example:
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sort_vector(a_vector) # returns a_vector in ascending order
sort_vector(a_vector, FALSE) # returns a vector in descending order
```

---
## "Scope" of a variable 

-  Variable Scoping
-  Variables that are bound to an R primitive or object outside a function are called global variables, and are accessible everywhere in an R program.
-  Example:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
x <- 5
test <- function() {
cat(x + 5)
}
test(); 
```

- Here 'x' is a "GLOBAL" variable - accessible from anywhere. 
---

## "Scope" (contd.)

-  Variables bound inside a function are only accessible within that function. These are called local variables. Example:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
x <- 10
test <- function() {
x <- 5
cat(x + 20)
}
test() #prints 25
cat(x + 20) #prints 30
```
-  **Note that the local variable assignment takes precedence inside the function test over the global assignment**.
---

## Side effects 

-  R functions have no side effects-- they cannot change the value of global variables. Example:
```{r, echo =  TRUE}
x <- 10
test <- function(z) {
z <- z + 10
cat(z)
}
test(x) #prints 20
cat(x) #prints 10
```
-  **Note that x is still bound to 10 outside of test()**.

# More about Functions

## Function Parts

Functions are defined by two components: the arguments (`formals`) and the code (`body`). Functions are assigned names like any other object in R (using `=` or `<-`)

```{r}
gcd = function(long1, lat1, long2, lat2) {
  R = 6371 # Earth mean radius in km
  
  # distance in km
  acos(sin(lat1)*sin(lat2) + cos(lat1)*cos(lat2) * cos(long2-long1)) * R
}
```

---

## Returning values

There are two approaches to returning values from functions in R - explicit and implicit return values.

--

**Explicit** - using one or more `return` statements

```{r}
f = function(x) {
  x + 1
  return(x * x)
}
f(2)
```

--

**Implicit** - return value of the last expression is returned.

```{r}
g = function(x) {
  x + 1
  x * x
}
g(3)
```

---

## Returning multiple values

If we want a function to return more than one value we can group things using either vectors or lists.

```{r}
f = function(x) {
  c(x, x^2, x^3)
}

f(1:2)
```

```{r}
g = function(x) {
  list(x, "hello")
}

g(1:2)
```

---
class: split-50

## Argument names

When defining a function we are also implicitly defining names for the arguments, when calling the function we can use these names to pass arguments in a alternative order.


```{r}
f = function(x, y, z) {
  paste0("x=", x, " y=", y, " z=", z)
}
```

.pull-left[
```{r, error=TRUE}
f(1, 2, 3)
f(z=1, x=2, y=3)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, error=TRUE}
f(y=2, 1, 3)
f(y=2, 1, x=3)
```
]

--

.pad-top[

```{r, error=TRUE}
f(1, 2, 3, 4)
f(1, 2, m=3)
```

]
---

## Argument defaults

It is also possible to give function arguments default values, so that they don't need to be provided every time the function is called.

```{r error=TRUE}
f = function(x, y=1, z=1) {
  paste0("x=", x, " y=", y, " z=", z)
}
```

.pull-left[
```{r error=TRUE}
f(3)
f(x=3)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r error=TRUE}
f(z=3, x=2)
f(y=2, 2)
```
]

--

.pad-top[
```{r, error=TRUE}
f()
```
]

---

## Scope

R has generous scoping rules, if it can't find a variable in the functions body, it will look for it in the next higher scope, and so on.

```{r}
y = 1
f = function(x) {
  x + y
}

f(3)
```

--

.pad-top[]

```{r}
y = 1
g = function(x) {
  y = 2
  x + y
}

g(3)
```

---

Additionally, variables defined within a scope only persist for the duration of that scope, and do not overwrite variables at a higher scopes

```{r}
x = 1
y = 1
z = 1
f = function() {
    y = 2
    g = function() {
      z = 3
      return(x + y + z)
    }
    return(g())
}
f()
c(x,y,z)
```

---

## Exercise - scope

What is the output of the following code? Explain why.

```{r eval=FALSE}
z = 1

f = function(x, y, z) {
  z = x+y

  g = function(m = x, n = y) {
    m/z + n/z
  }

  z * g()
}

f(1, 2, x = 3)
```

---

## Operators as functions

In R, operators are actually a special type of function - using backticks around the operator we can write them as functions.
 
```{r}
`+`
typeof(`+`)
```

--

.pad-top[]

```{r}
x = 4:1
x + 2
`+`(x, 2)
```


---

## Getting Help

Prefixing any function name with a `?` will open the related help file for that function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?`+`
?sum
```

For functions not in the base package, you can generally see their implementation by entering the function name without parentheses (or using the `body` function).

```{r}
lm
```

---

## Less Helpful Examples

```{r}
list

`[`

sum

`+`
```
